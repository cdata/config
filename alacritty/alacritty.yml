# Font configuration (changes require restart)
#
# Important font attributes like antialiasing, subpixel aa, and hinting can be
# controlled through fontconfig. Specifically, the following attributes should
# have an effect:
#   - hintstyle
#   - antialias
#   - lcdfilter
#   - rgba
#
# For instance, if you wish to disable subpixel antialiasing, you might set the
# rgba property to `none`. If you wish to completely disable antialiasing, you
# can set antialias to `false`.
#
# Please see these resources for more information on how to use fontconfig:

  # as modifying the line spacing, and `offset.x` as modifying the letter spacing.

    y: 0

  # Glyph offset determines the locations of the glyphs within their cells with
